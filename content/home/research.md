My research interests are continuous representations learning and their application to natural language processing and speech recognition tasks like ASR error detection, natural/spoken language understanding, named entity recognition, etc. I am also interested to end-to-end approaches for speech understanding in addition to sementic textual similarity and its application to dialog system.
