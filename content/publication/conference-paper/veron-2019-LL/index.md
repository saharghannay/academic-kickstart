abstract: "The main objective of this paper is to propose a functional definition of lifelong learning systems adapted to the framework of task-oriented dialogue sys- tems. We mainly identified two aspects where a lifelong learning technology could be applied in such systems: to improve the natural language understanding mod- ule and to enrich the database used by the system. Given our definition, we present an example of how it could be implemented in an existing task-oriented dialogue system that is developed in the LIHLITH project."
