abstract: "The  task  of  automatic  misogyny  identifica-tion  and  categorization  has  not  received  asmuch attention as other natural language taskshave,  even  though  it  is  crucial  for  identify-ing hate speech in social Internet interactions.In  this  work,  we  address  this  sentence  clas-sification  task  from  a  representation  learningperspective, using both a bidirectional LSTMand BERT optimized with the following met-ric  learning  loss  functions:   contrastive  loss,triplet  loss,  center  loss,  congenerous  cosineloss and additive angular margin loss.  We setnew state-of-the-art for the task with our fine-tuned BERT, whose sentence embeddings canbe  compared  with  a  simple  cosine  distance,and we release all our code as open source foreasy reproducibility. Moreover, we find that al-most every loss function performs equally wellin this setting, matching the regular cross en-tropy loss."
